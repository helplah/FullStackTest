ShopLah was created because I wanted to build a simple ecommerce website and familiarise myself more with authentication process and full-stack app flow. 

### Redux ###

I chose Redux because I have never used it before and I wanted to play around with it. I like the idea of getting back the same output for the same input very much - it's like Mathematics. 

However, the setup is a little verbose since you have to change/write code in a few places to make changes (like creating containers to mapStateToProps and mapDispatchToProps as compared to React). The upside is whenever there's a bug, it is a lot easier to track it down.
